## ForcedBed AI Description
As you can guess form our name, our bot is always forcing the oponent to bet or fold. We tried different sizes of the bet and we figured out that the optimal bet, that wins the most hands is a bet of 300 chips. We simply raise the oponent with the forced bet and wait for his decision. Applying this logic we are beating over half of our oponents.
